Current Manual Process & Challenges
	1.	Analysts manually extract entity names from diverse supporting documents, often in varied formats (PDF, Word, scans).
	2.	Manual entry of these entities into Actimize ODS for screening, leading to repetitive data handling.
	3.	Screening results from Actimize are retrieved individually for each entity or batch.
	4.	Results are manually compiled from multiple sources into a single report or PDF.
	5.	The process is time-consuming, prone to human error, and lacks audit-ready traceability for large volumes.

AI Adoption â€“ Benefits & Requirements (RAG, LangChain, AI Agents)
	1.	OCR + Entity Extraction Agent: Uses OCR to digitize scanned/structured documents, applies NER models to identify entity names, and validates against customer master data.
	2.	Actimize Integration Agent: Automates entity list submission to Actimize ODS APIs, schedules runs, and monitors screening job completion.
	3.	RAG for Policy-Grounded Screening: Retrieves and applies compliance rules, watchlist details, and screening thresholds from indexed AML/KYC policies stored in a vector DB.
	4.	Result Aggregation Agent: Automatically fetches screening outputs, merges them, applies RAG-based contextual notes, and compiles into a single standardized PDF report.
	5.	Infrastructure & Governance: Requires connectors to document repositories and Actimize API, LangChain orchestration for multi-agent workflows, Delta tables for intermediate storage, Unity Catalog for PII governance, and full audit logging of AI reasoning and actions.
