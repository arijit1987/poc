C. Compliance & Security
	8.	What certifications (SOC 2, ISO 27001, etc.) and compliance controls apply to Databricks Hosted Models?
References:
	•	(Typically available on the Databricks Trust and Compliance documentation page—not listed above but may require additional search in your portal.)

D. AI/BI Genie & Application Integration
	11.	For AI/BI Genie interactions, what is the data flow—specifically, where are prompts, queries, and generated responses stored?
References:
	•	(Documentation for Genie may be found in upcoming or Mosaic AI/GenAI sections—search “Genie Databricks” in your official docs.)
	12.	Are these stored ephemerally or persistently? Can storage be fully disabled?
References:
	•	As above—check the official tool or release documentation for Genie or Mosaic AI.
	13.	Can Genie integrate with enterprise authentication and custom role-based access control?
References:
	•	(Again, check in upcoming Mosaic AI or GenAI toolkit docs—look for “Mosaic AI Gateway” or “Genie authentication”.)
