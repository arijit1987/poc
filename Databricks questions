Yes — I can read the image, and it looks like you have an initial bullet list of discussion points for Databricks covering model hosting, access control, compliance, storage, AI/BI Genie, MLflow, vector databases, and more.

Here’s a refined professional-level question set for your Databricks technical meeting, structured for clarity and depth. I’ve grouped and rephrased them to sound precise, business-oriented, and technically actionable.

⸻

A. Model Hosting & Architecture
	1.	What are the recommended best practices for secure model hosting on Databricks, particularly in regulated environments like SMBC?
	2.	Can we host models fully within our enterprise network without sending any data to external Databricks-managed services?
	3.	How does Databricks handle model endpoint isolation and private network integration (e.g., Azure Private Link)?
	4.	In the event of multi-region deployments, how is model replication and latency handled?

⸻

B. Data Access & Governance
	5.	How can Unity Catalog be leveraged for granular access control over both model artifacts and training data?
	6.	What is the audit trail capability for model execution — can we track who accessed a model and what inputs/outputs were generated?
	7.	For hosted models, where exactly are interaction logs and inference requests stored, and how long are they retained?

⸻

C. Compliance & Security
	8.	What certifications (SOC 2, ISO 27001, etc.) and compliance controls apply to Databricks Hosted Models?
	9.	Can Databricks support regional data residency requirements so that no data leaves a given jurisdiction?
	10.	How does Databricks handle PII masking or filtering for inputs and outputs processed by hosted models?

⸻

D. AI/BI Genie & Application Integration
	11.	For AI/BI Genie interactions, what is the data flow — specifically, where are prompts, queries, and generated responses stored?
	12.	Are these stored ephemerally or persistently? Can storage be fully disabled?
	13.	Can Genie integrate with enterprise authentication and custom role-based access control?

⸻

E. Development, MLOps & Deployment
	14.	How can MLflow be configured for multi-team collaboration while maintaining model versioning and access control boundaries?
	15.	What is the recommended CI/CD pipeline design for deploying models into production in Databricks using MLOps best practices?
	16.	Are there deployment patterns to minimize downtime during model upgrades or retraining cycles?

⸻

F. Vector Databases & Storage
	17.	Where exactly is the vector database hosted in a Databricks setup — customer-managed or Databricks-managed infrastructure?
	18.	What types of metadata and embeddings are stored, and can we enforce data encryption at rest & in transit?
	19.	Is page-level or document-level chunking supported, and can the chunk identifiers map to business-specific keys (e.g., page numbers)?

⸻

G. Python & Package Management
	20.	For open-source Python packages not natively available in Databricks, what is the process for installing and managing dependencies in a controlled, secure manner?
	21.	Are there sandbox or isolated cluster options for testing custom packages before production rollout?

If you want, I can also convert this into a visually structured meeting prep sheet with categories, a table for “Question | Purpose | Expected Databricks Input,” so your technical team can track responses easily. This format tends to be very effective in vendor meetings.
