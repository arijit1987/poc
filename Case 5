Current Manual Process & Challenges
	1.	Manual rescreening of transactions is triggered based on value dates, requiring analysts to re-run the same data sets.
	2.	Comparison of current screening results with initial results is done manually to identify any changes.
	3.	No-change scenarios still require human validation, wasting time and resources.
	4.	Manual tracking and tagging of historical screening and mitigation comments for each customer.
	5.	Repeated mitigation work is required for the same hits due to lack of automated historical match referencing.

AI Adoption – Benefits & Requirements (RAG, LangChain, AI Agents)
	1.	Rescreening Orchestration Agent: Automates scheduling of rescreens based on value dates and transaction metadata using LangChain workflows.
	2.	Result Comparison Agent: Automatically compares new screening outputs with historical records, identifies changes, and triggers conditional workflows (notify or escalate).
	3.	RAG-powered Context Retrieval: Retrieves historical screening decisions, mitigation notes, and customer-specific tagging from a vector database to guide decision logic.
	4.	Notification & Escalation Agent: Sends automated “no change” notifications or routes “changes detected” cases for manual mitigation via API integrations with case management tools.
	5.	Governed Data Infrastructure: Requires API connectors to screening tools, Delta tables for storing historical decisions, Unity Catalog for secure PII handling, embedding pipelines for historical notes, and full audit logging of AI-driven comparisons and decisions.
