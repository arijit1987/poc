Current Manual Process & Challenges
	1.	Analysts manually run multiple product-specific T24 reports on a T+1 basis, downloading each separately.
	2.	eKYC reports are extracted manually at the start of each month and used for the entire month.
	3.	Manual matching of T24 transactions with CPDAP country risk lists to flag high-risk jurisdictions and tax havens.
	4.	High-value/low-value transaction flagging and “new-to-bank” customer identification done via manual spreadsheet operations.
	5.	Customers whose risk ratings change mid-month are missed due to no automated re-check, creating compliance gaps.

AI Adoption – Benefits & Requirements (RAG, LangChain, AI Agents)
	1.	Automated T24 Ingestion Agent: Uses LangChain tools to schedule and retrieve all T24 product-specific reports in parallel, normalizing into Delta tables.
	2.	Dynamic eKYC Integration Agent: Fetches eKYC updates daily or on-change events, automatically re-evaluating customers whose risk status changes mid-month.
	3.	RAG for Risk Rule Application: Retrieves CPDAP risk criteria, tax haven lists, and compliance guidelines from a vector database to apply consistent, explainable rules to T24 data.
	4.	Risk Scoring & Sampling Agent: Combines T24, eKYC, and CPDAP data to generate composite risk scores, auto-select samples for review, and prioritize high-risk cases.
	5.	Governance & Infrastructure: Requires secure connectors to T24/eKYC systems, vector DB (Databricks Vector Search/FAISS), Unity Catalog for PII governance, full audit logging, and Delta Live Tables for data freshness.
