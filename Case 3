Current Manual System & Challenges
	1.	Screeners manually check Google hits from DDIQ that are not auto-adjudicated.
	2.	Each hitâ€™s source article is opened and fully read to assess relevance.
	3.	Long-form content review takes significant time, especially for multiple hits.
	4.	Fatigue may cause oversight of key facts or context.
	5.	No quick way to triage or prioritize articles based on likely risk relevance.

AI Benefits & Requirements (RAG, LangChain, AI Agents)
	1.	Document Retrieval Agent (LangChain) fetches full article text from DDIQ hit URLs and cleans it for processing.
	2.	RAG Pipeline indexes AML/KYC policy guidelines and prior adjudication decisions in a vector database to ground AI summaries with compliance context.
	3.	Summarization Agent uses a fine-tuned LLM to create concise, risk-focused summaries and highlight key entities, aligning with adjudication criteria.
	4.	Classification & Prioritization Agent scores each summary for probable risk relevance, enabling triage before human review.
	5.	Governance & Integration: Secure API connectors to DDIQ, encrypted storage for articles/summaries, Unity Catalog-based access control, and full audit logging of AI reasoning outputs.
