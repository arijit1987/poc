Slide 1 – Emerging Data & AI Capabilities for Future Banking
Data Clean Rooms

Definition: Secure, privacy-preserving environments that allow multiple institutions to perform joint analytics without exposing raw data.

Facilitation: Use encrypted computation and access controls to enable AML monitoring, credit risk collaboration, and market intelligence across entities.

Use Cases:

Detect suspicious AML patterns without sharing sensitive customer data.

Pool data for credit risk stress testing under strict confidentiality.

Share competitive intelligence insights safely.

Azure Confidential Computing

Definition: Leverages Trusted Execution Environments (TEEs) to protect data while in use, ensuring confidentiality during processing.

Facilitation: Deploy critical workloads (fraud detection, cash management, KYC) in Azure enclave-protected VMs.

Use Cases:

Secure payment instructions and customer PII on Azure.

Train fraud/KYC ML models on encrypted data.

Ensure regulatory reporting compliance through data isolation.

AI & BI Democratization

Definition: Make analytics accessible to business teams via natural language interfaces and embedded AI-driven insights.

Facilitation: Expand Power BI with governance, integrate conversational analytics and embed AI insights into existing workflows.

Use Cases:

Query curated datasets in plain language.

Integrate AI-driven recommendations into apps.

Enable self-service BI with strict governance & role-based access.

Slide 2 – Advanced AI Governance & Strategic Readiness
Vector Databases & Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG)

Definition: Use semantic vector search to improve generative AI responses with grounded, compliant, and accurate sources.

Facilitation: Build enterprise-grade RAG pipelines integrated with policy documents and internal knowledge bases.

Use Cases:

Regulatory & policy Q&A with authoritative citations.

Automating document processing (onboarding, loans, contracts).

Knowledge assistants for employees with cited responses.

Quantum Computing Preparedness

Definition: Anticipating risks quantum computing poses to cryptographic systems; ensuring crypto-agility and resilience.

Facilitation: Maintain an enterprise-wide cryptographic inventory and test quantum-safe algorithms.

Use Cases:

Identify cryptographic dependencies across systems.

Run pilots with post-quantum encryption standards.

Implement frameworks for seamless algorithm updates.

Advanced Machine Learning Operations (MLOps)

Definition: A governance and operational framework ensuring AI/ML models are reliable, compliant, and auditable.

Facilitation: Standardize model development pipelines, embed governance & monitoring into ML lifecycle.

Use Cases:

Centralized feature store for consistency.

Automated monitoring for fraud/credit drift detection.

Regulatory-grade governance embedded in model pipelines.
