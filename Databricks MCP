Got it — I’ll prepare you a consolidated single slide that shows:
	•	What MCP Servers are
	•	How to configure them in Databricks (both managed MCP Beta and free-tier workarounds)
	•	How MCP interacts with Databricks Agents, Genie, UC Functions, and Vector Search
	•	A detailed architecture diagram showing the data and function flow.

Slide Content – “MCP Servers in Databricks: Usage & Architecture”

⸻

1. What is MCP (Model Context Protocol)?
	•	Definition: An open standard for connecting external tools, databases, APIs, and functions to an LLM.
	•	In Databricks: MCP servers act as connectors between Databricks agents (or Genie) and UC Functions, Vector Search indexes, or external services.
	•	Benefit: Allows LLM agents to call code, run queries, or fetch data dynamically during a conversation.

2. Usage in Databricks

Two main configurations:
	1.	Managed MCP Servers (Beta)
	•	Requires Pro+ Databricks plan
	•	Must enroll in MCP Servers Beta via Databricks support
	•	Hosted by Databricks, fully integrated with Playground, Genie Spaces, Agents
	2.	Self-hosted MCP Servers (Free Tier Workaround)
	•	Host MCP server locally or in cloud (VM, Azure, etc.)
	•	Expose via HTTP/WebSocket to Databricks Agent
	•	Use “Add Your Own Tool” → connect to MCP endpoint

⸻

3. MCP Configuration Steps (Managed Beta)
	1.	Request MCP Servers Beta entitlement
	2.	Go to Playground → Add Tool → MCP Servers
	3.	Select MCP server source (UC Functions, Vector Search, Genie Spaces, or custom endpoint)
	4.	Save & Test in Playground or Genie
